# Primitive Login and Signup
This is the second version of my "signup and login" script made for python where the main goal is to apply what I've learned so far:
 
  - classes
  - libraries
  - modules
  - loops

2.0 Changes:

Implementation of the following things I've learned and found useful to add to this project:

  - sockets
  - sqlite3

In the "signup e login" folder you will find:
  
  The classes.py contains all the attributes for the People class and all its functions that connect to the server/database.
  The teste.py is where I test new code before adding it to the other files (also helps with organization).
  The main.py is where the program is initialized and asks for user input.

In the "database e server" folder you will find all the functions to initialize, add
and check the given values in the database. There is also the server script where 
you will find all the server coding.

In order for everything to work, you have to change the server.connect() function's IP and port relative to the IP you are going to use and the port as well. Remember to start the python server script first, and then the main.py.
